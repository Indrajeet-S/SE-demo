Explanation

Form Submission Handling:
The form's submit event is intercepted using JavaScript to prevent the default form submission behavior.
The form data is collected from the input fields.
The collected data is stored in the browser's local storage.

Download Button:
A separate button (Download All Data) is provided to download all the collected data.
When this button is clicked, the data is retrieved from local storage, formatted into a CSV string, and a download link is created and clicked programmatically.
This approach allows users to submit multiple student entries and download all the collected data as a single CSV file.
